## What is a JavaScript ?
### `JavaScript` is a programming language used to create and control dynamic website content. (i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or changes on-screen without reloading a web page).

# There are 6 basic data types in JavaScript:
 - A number
 - A string
 - A boolean (logical type)
 - The “null” value
 - The “undefined” value
 - Objects and Symbols


# For example
## number
```js
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
```
## string
```js
let greeting = "Hello";
let name = "John";
```

# Symbol
### In JavaScript, Symbol() is a built-in function that creates a unique and immutable data type called a Symbol. Symbols are often used as property keys for object properties, particularly when you want to ensure that the property key is unique and not accidentally overwritten or conflicted with other keys.

# Biglnt
### BigInt values represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive.
